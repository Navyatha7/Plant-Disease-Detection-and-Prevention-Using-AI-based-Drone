In the agricultural sector, early and accurate detection of plant diseases is essential for 
optimizing crop health and minimizing losses. Conventional methods of disease detection are 
often slow, labor-intensive, and challenging to scale. This paper presents an AI-based approach 
utilizing drone technology and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automate the 
process of plant disease detection and management. Drones equipped with imaging sensors 
capture high-resolution images across crop fields, which are then uploaded to a dedicated 
website for analysis. The CNN algorithm processes these images to identify diseases based on 
distinct visual features, providing targeted treatment recommendations, including both organic 
and inorganic solutions. By leveraging CNNs for precise disease diagnosis, this system 
supports sustainable farming practices while reducing dependency on chemical treatments and 
enhancing crop productivity.
